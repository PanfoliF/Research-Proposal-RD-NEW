  abstract = {We discuss three different areas in which policies on gender and the family have been debated and formulated in Brazil, revealing both the forces of change and the many contradictions that are at work within this society today. After a brief look at the historical vicissitudes of families and family life in Brazil, as representations and as forms of social organization, we come to our more immediate context: the re-democratization processes that engulfed Brazilian society as of the 1980s and the social actors generated therein. Issues relating to gender and sexuality become increasingly visible on the broad political agenda that, notwithstanding national specificities, also converges with social, political and cultural trends emerging all over the world in the latter decades of the twentieth century. The three specific issues we discuss here—the Maria da Penha Law on domestic violence, efforts regarding the legalization of abortion and recent debates that have emerged around a bill introduced to give legal status to same-sex relationships—provide testimony of a society characterized by tensions between mechanisms sustaining restrictive definitions of family, linked to male dominance, heterosexism and hierarchical gender roles, and those that push toward more egalitarian, diverse and democratic family relations.},

  abstract = {The main purpose of this paper is to discuss critical linkages between climate change, migration and health, with a particular focus on Brazil. One of the potential impacts of climate change is to induce population displacements, which may in some cases aggravate situations of vulnerability. It is likely, especially in tropical and developing countries, that future population migration induced by climate change may increase population vulnerability given the potential redistribution of endemic infectious diseases. This paper provides a discussion on linkages between climate change, migration and health and analyzes an in-depth case study on Brazil’s Northeast Region between 2025 and 2050, in which projected climate changes are analyzed in terms of their potential impacts on population migration and increased vulnerability, particularly in terms of population health. Finally, the paper discusses how the effects of climate change on future scenarios of increased vulnerability of some population groups can be factored-in to Brazilian public policy and planning, helping to promote prompt and strong action in terms of creation or adaptation of institutional settings at different scales.},

I used data from the Brazilian Census for the years 1991 and 2000 and loglinear models. The results show that homogamy-heterogamy rates have traditionally been overestimated, as demonstrated by a change that ranges between 15.3 percent and 43.2 percent, when the local racial distribution of spouses is considered. The gap between the percentage differences is smaller in 2000 than in 1991. When analyzing the homogamy-heterogamy rates for each marriage market, one observes that the interaction between a spouse’s race and the marriage market is important, with very few exceptions. In addition, although most meso-regions have homogamy-heterogamy rates similar to the average, there are some important regional differences, especially in the South, where the levels are higher than the average.},

Results show that high-frequency users tend to be from higher socioeconomic groups. Girls and higher-income children perceive higher levels of risk on the Internet. The most common areas of use are related to learning and social life. The type of guidance that children receive matters: active mediation strategies at home and school are vital for increasing children’s digital opportunities, while restrictive mediation tends to reduce them. Also, parental mediation appears to be unequally distributed, showing differences by age, gender and socioeconomic group. These results contribute to discussions on promoting digital opportunities and reducing risks.},

The results show that economic growth has become less important in that debate than other conditioning factors over the last few years. The current pattern of education spending contributes to the maintenance of social vulnerability, thereby making it harder for individuals to participate fully in society. In contrast, increases in formal education and formalization have made opportunities less unequal.},

The obstacles that the poorest older persons face in securing their livelihoods, compounded by physiological and metabolic changes and the presence of chronic diseases, make them more vulnerable. This study evaluates the impact of the Continuous Benefit Programme (BPC) on the nutritional status and food security levels of older persons in Brazil, using a fuzzy regression discontinuity design with microdata drawn from the 2017–2018 Consumer Expenditure Survey (POF). On average, participation in the programme is found to increase the probability that an older person will be food-secure, and to reduce his/her chances of suffering mild food insecurity. Although the objective of the programme is to reduce poverty, these findings can support the formulation of public policies that promote the quality of life of older persons, by acting on purchasing power, health and nutrition.},

  abstract = {Amazonas state represents 37\% of the Amazônia biome in Brazil. Although Amazonas remains 98\% forested, its contribution to annual biome deforestation increased substantially in the past ten years. Herein, the connections between population and deforestation in Amazonas are investigated from 1985 through 2020. Anthropogenic landcover fraction and population density varied spatially and temporally across the 62 municipalities of the state. The temporal variability had specific geographic patterns, and three microregions were identified. Economic development along the southern border, arising from agricultural activities in the pattern of classical deforestation in Amazônia, was characterized by large increases in anthropogenic landcover but only small changes in population. Economic development along the Amazon River, characterized by large increases in population and anthropogenic landcover, represented urbanization and the growth of industry and agriculture. Economic development along the western border, based on trade and commerce with Peru and Colombia, corresponded to increases in population without large increases in anthropogenic landcover. The three microregions were quantitatively characterized by different slopes between anthropogenic landcover fraction and population density. The connections between deforestation and population varied by a factor of 50 × among the different microregions, suggesting important considerations for the future forest preservation in Amazonas. That time is now given the increasing importance of this region, which twice approached 20\% of the total annual deforestation in Amazônia over the past decade.},

Combining a quantitative analysis based on the National Household Sample Survey (PNAD) and a qualitative survey carried out among households belonging to the middle class, it reveals the following characteristics. First, the Brazilian middle class is heterogeneous and a substantial part of it remains vulnerable to poverty. Second, the middle class exhibits consumer behaviour largely sustained by credit. Third, in terms of expectations, the Brazilian middle class prioritizes health, education, security and housing and is particularly critical of the quality of public services, all the more so as it faces a high tax burden. While the upper middle class is able to bypass these failures via private services, the most vulnerable elements of the middle class remain very dependent on these low-quality public services.},

Antisera to the 3 isolates contained the corresponding antibody groups. The antibody group (M) shared by all 3 BYMV isolates was present in the FvM1 antiserum in a level only a little higher than the second antibody group (A). Antisera to TpM3 and TpM11 isolates showed only a low titre of M antibody, while the second antibody group (N) reached titres from 512 to 1024. Cross-absorption tests revealed serological identity of both isolates of the "necrotic type" (TpM3 and TpM11) and allowed to estimate the degree of their serological relatedness to representatives of the "mosaic type" isolates of BYMV (FvM1).},

This paper examines the contribution of the ‘‘population factor’’ as a cause of deforestation in Machadinho D’Oeste, Rondˆonia, Brazilian Amazonia, an area with significant small-scale farming. Conceptually, the paper shows that socioeconomic status and mediating factors (i.e., education, managerial skills, previous rural experience, integration into the local, and regional contexts), and attitudes and behaviors toward the land parcel development mediate migrants’ relationships with the local environment. The analysis combines multiple data sources (i.e., demographic census, household survey, land-cover maps, in-depth interviews) and analytical approaches (i.e., fuzzy sets statistics, remote-sensing/GIS analysis, interpretivist qualitative assessment) to examine the complex interrelationships between LUCC and human population.},

Contextual factors made it possible to explain 79\% of the difference between schools. The raw average and value-added (random effect at the school level) produced contrasting evaluations in 34\% of cases; and the average was more stable (r = 0.8) than value-added (r = 0.5) in both years. Various shortcomings in the enem as an indicator of school effectiveness were identified. The results show that this league table reveals more about socioeconomic conditions than the schools’ own merit, in other words the value-added they are supposedly providing to the students.},

We use the database on deforestation published by the Brazilian space research center (INPE) and the population census data released by the federal geographical and statistical agency IBGE at their finest scale: the census tract level. By crossing the population density and deforestation variables, we identify ten human settlement patterns in the Amazon. There are low-low and high-high classes of population density and deforestation, but also low-high and high-low classes. This analysis helps understand the low overall relations in the Amazon for population and deforestation. We emphasize the expansion of large-scale agriculture and cattle ranching as causing the depopulation of rural areas while in many regions of the Amazon quite strong population densities coexist with relatively low extents of deforestation. Such findings stress the need to implement case-specific public policies in these regions in order to encourage human presence compatible with the conservation of forest cover and biodiversity. We also confirm the importance of the Amazon urbanization process, including the ‘discrete urbanization’ of rural areas, and the need to better recognize the distinct social and environmental problems of urban areas.},

  abstract = {This text aims to make some approximations in relation to the 1st and 2nd grades reform law no. 5,692 of 1971 and the reform of secondary education, law no. 13,415 of 2017. Among other aspects, it is possible to point out the pro fessionalization process in the training of students in the 1971 reform and the induction of professionalization at the high school level with the current proposal, both inserted in coup contexts (civil-military in 1964 and legal-media-parliamentary in 2016). Methodologically, the article was developed through bibliographic research (consultation of works and scientific articles), as well as documents related to the theme. Considering that there are similarities between the reforms, resulting in developments for public education, the text has a preliminary character, which will require, for a more complete approach, in the perspective of totality, the development of new research.},

  abstract = {The objective of this article is to understand the class, race and gender profile of persons who would be most affected if the Brazilian State were to stop providing health and education services. The article begins with a review of class, race and gender inequalities in Brazil, and then examines the role of the State in that regard. The second section presents an analysis of public education and health expenditures through a discussion of the class, race and gender profiles of users and a simulation of the elimination of public health and education spending. The third section contains concluding remarks. The article proposes that the elimination of public services would plunge poorer, Black2 and female populations (categories which often overlap) into severe financial hardship and negatively affect their well-being and could deepen poverty or lead to extreme poverty.},

  abstract = {Background: Although marriage is associated with favourable reproductive outcomes among adult women, it is not known whether the marriage advantage applies to girls ({$<$} 18 years). The contribution of girl child marriage ({$<$} 18 years) to perinatal health is understudied in the Americas. Methods: National singleton birth registrations were used to estimate the prevalence of girl child marriage among mothers in Brazil (2011–2018, N = 23,117,661), Ecuador (2014–2018, N = 1,519,168), the USA (2014–2018, N = 18,618,283) and Canada (2008–2018, N = 3,907,610). The joint associations between marital status and maternal age groups ({$<$} 18, 18–19 and 20–24 years) with preterm birth ({$<$} 37 weeks), small‑for‑gestational age (SGA {$<$} 10 percen‑tile) and repeat birth were assessed with logistic regression. Results: The proportion of births to {$<$} 18‑year‑old mothers was 9.9\% in Ecuador, 8.9\% in Brazil, 1.5\% in the United States and 0.9\% in Canada, and marriage prevalence among {$<$} 18‑year‑old mothers was 3.0\%, 4.8\%, 3.7\% and 1.7\%, respectively. In fully‑adjusted models, marriage was associated with lower odds of preterm birth and SGA among 20–24‑year‑old mothers in the four countries. Compared to unmarried 20–24‑year‑old women, married and unmar‑ried {$<$} 18‑year‑old girls had higher odds of preterm birth in the four countries, and slightly higher odds of SGA in Brazil and Ecuador but not in the USA and Canada. In comparisons within age groups, the odds of repeat birth among {$<$} 18‑year‑old married mothers exceeded that of their unmarried counterparts in Ecuador [AOR: 1.99, 95\%CI: 1.82, 2.18], the USA [AOR: 2.96, 95\%CI: 2.79, 3.14], and Canada [AOR: 2.17, 95\%CI: 1.67, 2.82], although minimally in Brazil [AOR: 1.09, 95\%CI: 1.07, 1.11]. Conclusions: The prevalence of births to {$<$} 18‑year‑old mothers varies considerably in the Americas. Girl child marriage was differentially associated with perinatal health indicators across countries, suggesting context‑specific mechanisms.},
