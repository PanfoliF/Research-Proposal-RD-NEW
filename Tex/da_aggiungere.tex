% Do not include control variables that are a consequence of the key IV.

% Alternatives to Statistical Control
% Substitute research design for control variables (i.e. control through case selection)
% – Test a theory in a particular place, at a particular time.
% – Provide tests for observable implications in as many as possible narrow, focused, controlled circumstances. e.g. particular actors, groups, space, time, natural experiments…
% – Choose circumstances where competing theories provide deviant observable implications.

% What is causality
% • Causal inference is a type of prediction, but it’s a prediction of a
% counterfactual associated with a particular choice taken
% • To make predictions about counterfactuals we need to have a theory
% about the data generating process (DGP): a causal model
% • We observe only some data produced by a DGP
% • We want to learn something about what data the DGP would have
% produced in a counterfactual scenario
