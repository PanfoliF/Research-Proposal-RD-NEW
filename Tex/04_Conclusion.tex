\section*{Conclusion}
The puzzle motivating this paper was deliberately simple: two elephant-human encounters occur in broadly similar environments, yet they generate sharply different behavioural trajectories. In one occasion, the elephant's threat is forceful but calibrated; in the other, violence is followed by a striking form of care.
